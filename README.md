# UFO believer or not

# Abstract

Our project aims to deeper analyze data on UFO sightings and see if the 'official' reports of the sightings can be believable by doing text analysis. Based on the given event-descriptions, we would like to perform a sentiment analysis to classify weather the observer had positive, neutral or negative emotions/experience. If the data serves enough output we furthermore would like to determine polarity in terms of belief in extraterrestrial life.

Furthermore we would like to tell is there a location correlation to the reportings, and are the reportings concentrated around some specific 'mysterious' areas?

For the base we are using a collection of UFO sightings from THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER which contains data from 1974 to the latest report. We would be using google queries for cross validation of the hot-spots of UFO sightings and common astronomical/weather phenomena which might be inline with UFO sightings.


# Research questions

1. Are UFO sightings trustable?
2. Are UFO sightings more prevalent in rural regions?
3. Can a reliability factor be determined from the length and complexity of the report?
4. Are there 'hot-spots' where there are more reporting and what could lead to these hot-spots? 
5. Is there a correlation between UFO sightings and the weather?
6. What can we say about the language of the reporting and how did it change from 1974 to now?

# Dataset
* The NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center) has been collecting UFO sightings since 1974. [Dataset](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html)


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Scrape NUFORC data from the website
- Structurize the NUFORC data
- Get some general ideas about the geo-distribution of the reports
- Analyze the reporting for different words and visualize which words are most common
