# UFO believer or not

# Abstract

UFOs have been around for a while, or haven't they? Our project aims to deeper analyze data on UFO sightings and extract social aspects such as level of mental health, religious beliefs and many more. Furthermore we would like to tell how the classic average UFO reporter looks like, where does he come from, which background does he or she have and how frequently they perceive UFO's.

Therefore we need to make use of multiple datasets. For the base we are using a collection of UFO sightings from THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER which contains data from 1974 to the latest report. To calculate possible misconceptions we target to use astronomical data. Furthermore we use Twitterdata to connect UFO sightings to the same timestamp in twitter.

sentence on our motivation: 

# Research questions
1. Can there be found a relation between mental health, beliefs of reported location averages to the sightings?
2. What is the correlation of twitter UFO reportings and 'official' reports?
3. Can a reliability factor be determined from the length and complexity of the report?
4. Are there 'hot-spots' where there are more reporting and what could lead to these hot-spots? 
5. Is there a correlation between UFO sightings and astronomical phenomena?
6. What is the impact of Twitter appearance on UFO sightings?

# Dataset
* The NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center) has been collecting UFO sightings since 1974. [Dataset](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html)
* Twitter Dataset


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Clean and organize the data to get a well structured data structure with dates. Organize and filter twitter data, to correlate UFO sightings on twitter with the NUFORC. 
Structure and gather data on astronomical phenomena and see connections between official phenomena and reports.


# Questions for TAa
* Where do we get the Twitter Dataset? ( The [Google Documents](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D464uqlEBae7PKVs_Nyw0Kmqxnsnhzwx9rlLLmrZxc0/edit#gid=0) does not contain a link )
