            <p>The National UFO Reporting Center (<a href="http://nuforc.org">NUFORC</a>) is an organization in the
                United States that investigates and collects UFO sightings since 1974. The reports are publically
                available. We analyzed the reports in order to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Are UFO sightings explainable?</li>
                <li>Is there any relation between shape and emotion?</li>

            <h3 class="title">What kind of data do we have?</h3>
            <p>The NUFORC checks each reports for fakes or hoax and comments them accordingly. The reports are
                classified by their occurred date,
                location, shape and duration. </p>

                    Leaving my office after working well into the night, an amber orb of light moved across the sky
                    above me to the south of my location and then seemed to become multiple lights (still in one unit)
                    and became more white colored. The light blinked at an interval but not like any plane I’ve seen. It
                    made no sound yet was only a couple hundred feet above ground. It then turned west and south and I
                    lost sight of it for a few seconds behind buildings as I drove. It then came flying back north right
                    over me as I drove West it. Then it got higher in the sky and trurned sharply east towards Chicago
                    and paralleled interstate 90 (which I was now on going east as well) and it traveled around 90-100
                    mph before blinking out of site ahead of me. I noticed several other small lights in the sky. I felt
                    some moved and were planes others may be stars. But this area doesn’t get much visibility to stars
                    because of light pollution. This is O'Hare airport area, but this was not typical for flight
                    patterns and it turned to fast and was too small to be a plane. My cars engine light and and lights
                    went on for the first time ever (the car is in great shape) after the incident.</p>

            <p>
                Reading the above report gives you the impression, that these might be explainable with common sense,
                like air craft or meteorite or some sort of seasonal data. Thus we are looking deeper
                into the possible explanations for reports in general.

            <p>The previous analysis only covers spikes, which are create themselves due to the bias of reporters. Thus,

                Sentiment anlylsis
            </h3>
            <p>For sentiment analysis we are looking into what types of emotions and
              proceses can be apprehended from the reports. Though to understand that
              we must look into the distribution of the reports in general. Meaning,
              what is the distribution of word count within the reports.
                <img src="img/wordcount.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
              <p>We can clearly see that the word count follows a normal distribution with
              a mean shift to the left</p>
              <p>To see what kind of emotions are more prevalent within in the reportings,
                we are further looking into the percentages of emotions/perceptions found
                within the reports.
                <img src="img/boxplot_emotion.png" alt="" class="img_fluid"></p>
              <p>We can see that both positive and negative emotions are rather commonly
                found in the reports, as well as 'tentative' and 'certain' cognitive processes.
                Which is why we are looking into these emotions together with the senses of 'hear'
                and 'feel' and how are they showed for the most popular shapes.
