                is an organization in the United States that investigates
                and collects UFO sightings since 1974. The reports are publically available. We analyzed the reports
                in order to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Are UFO sightings explainable?</li>
                <li>Is there any relation between shape and emotion?</li>

            <h3 class="title">What kind of data do we have?</h3>
            <p>The NUFORC checks each reports for fakes or hoax and comments them accordignly. The reports are
                classified by their occurred date,
                location, shape and duration. </p>

            <p> To get a taste for an UFO report, here are two typical UFO encounters: </p>

                    Leaving my office after working well into the night, an amber orb of light moved across the sky
                    above me to the south of my location and then seemed to become multiple lights (still in one unit)
                    and became more white colored. The light blinked at an interval but not like any plane I’ve seen. It
                    made no sound yet was only a couple hundred feet above ground. It then turned west and south and I
                    lost sight of it for a few seconds behind buildings as I drove. It then came flying back north right
                    over me as I drove West it. Then it got higher in the sky and trurned sharply east towards Chicago
                    and paralleled interstate 90 (which I was now on going east as well) and it traveled around 90-100
                    mph before blinking out of site ahead of me. I noticed several other small lights in the sky. I felt
                    some moved and were planes others may be stars. But this area doesn’t get much visibility to stars
                    because of light pollution. This is O'Hare airport area, but this was not typical for flight
                    patterns and it turned to fast and was too small to be a plane. My cars engine light and and lights
                    went on for the first time ever (the car is in great shape) after the incident.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Are the reports explainable?</h3>
            <p>
                Reading the above report gives you the impression, that these might be explainable with common sense,
                like air craft or meteorite or some sort of seasonal data. Thus we are looking deeper
                into the possible explanations for reports in general.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Occurred and Reported</h3>
            <p>
                A reports submission splits into three parts, 'Occurred' when the UFO sighting was
                noticed, 'Reported' when the sighting was reported to the NUFORC and 'Posted' when
                the actual report was published online.

                The report with the oldest occurrence time is from 1762 which is a report
                from a London newspaper: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50113.html

               As pandas datetime deals with only years starting from 1900 and there
                would be very little reliability with reports so old, we will be looking into reports only starting from 1900.

                Our goal is to understand if we can explain the results through specific events,
                 like rocket launches, seasonal weather analysis, etc.

                Thus we show the amount of reports occuring  per each month over our time period.

                #first plot
            </p>
            <p>
              This plot shows the amount of reported occurances per month from 1900-2018.
              We can see a very clear trend that during the summer months when is an increase in submitted reports.
              This can be reasoned with very logicaly, because during warmer periods
               people tend to spend more time outside, thus have a higher probability
                of making a sighting of a UFO.

              But we see a clear increase in July, thus we will be investigating
               this month more, by plotting the reports from July over the time frame 1900 to 2018.
               ## 2ND PLOT BIAAATCH
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, here things start to become very interesting. We can quite obviously
               see an increase for the 4th of July, as a lot of sightings might be connected with the fireworks in the US.

              Though, another very clear increase is on the 15th of July, but after
               a google query, no specific occurance in the month of July was found.
                Thus, an investigation of the 15th of July over the years occurs.
                What is more interesting, is that the increase on the 15th day of
                 the month can be seen across multiple months.

                 ## the figure of 12 plots
            </p>
            <p>
              We can see a very clear trend across all months, that during
               the 15th day of the month there is a sudden increase in occured
                reportings of UFOs. Also, in most months there is a peak on the
                 first day of the month and in some on the last one. And in some
                  months there are also other peaks, which most of the time can
                   be explained due to holidays, such as the 4th of July of
                    New Years Eve, when fireworks are very prevalent.

              To get a better understanding of the peaks that occur in the middle
               of the month, we will plot the time between the Occurrence and
                Reporting of the sighting over days of the month.

                ##boxplotzzz
            </p>
            <p>
              We see that we have some suspicious dates, where the mean is
              higher than for the other ones, these days fall on 'round' numbers,
               thus we propose that these dates are artificially inflated. In other
                words, UFO reporters which submit their reports after a longer time
                 will have a bias towards round dates, which has been shown in
                  previous research as well. {ref: Huttenlocher (1990)}

              To check this further we will do Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on these
              dates to see if their empirical distribution matches the distribution
               of the other dates.
               From the test we got a p-value \<\0.05, thus we can reject the null
               hypothesis, meaning, that they are not of the same distribution.
               This further means, that reporters have a certain bias towards round
                dates after a long time between the occurance of the sighting and
                the reporting itself.
            </p>
          <h2 class="title">Other spikes</h3>
            <p>

              The previous analysis only covers spikes, which are create themselves
               due to the bias of reporters. Thus, it is not an explanation per say
               of the reports, but of the reason why they aggragate at these specific dates.

              To look more in depth in special cases/other peaks, we are plotting
               intensity of occurrence over the period 2004-2007 for all the months.

               #interactive plot
            </p>
            <p>
              After some manual searching for the peaks we found reasons for some
              of them, while other were reported in the news as UFOs as well.

              15th April 2004, Florida sightings connected with rocket launch

               mention different shapes and sizes, no seemind connection with
                weather or anything else.

              29th April 2006, a lot of reports from Portaland, Oregon, reports
              describe similar to that of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_(UFO)

              1st of October 2006, reports from Colorado and New Mexico, no
               seeming correlation to meteorite showers or weather.

              28th of November 2006, often described as fireball, possible
               explanation meteor event https://www.amsmeteors.org/members/imo_view/event/2006/448

              16th of December 2006, possible explanation: meteor
               event https://www.amsmeteors.org/members/imo_view/event/2006/492

              19-20th of June 2007, possible explanation, ISS docking of a

              12th of August 2007, meteor shower at the time http://m.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/First_glimpses_from_the_Perseid_meteor_shower, though a lot of reports mention that they saw UFO within the meteor shower.

              12th of December 2007, Atlas rocket fuel dump https://britastro.org/node/5886
            </p>
            <p>
              By manually checking the days of the peaks we could find
              reasonable explanations for most of them, such as rocket launches,
               space station fueling missions, meteorites, etc. But at the same time
                some peaks didn't leave any seeming correlation with events that
                 could be explainable from earth/space weather or known human made flyers.
