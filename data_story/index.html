                The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_UFO_Reporting_Center">[1]</a>
                is an organization in the United States that investigates
                and collects UFO sightings since 1974. The reports are publically available. We analyzed the reports
                in order to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Are UFO sightings explainable?</li>
                <li>Is there any relation between shape and emotion?</li>

            <h3 class="title">What kind of data do we have?</h3>
            <p>The NUFORC checks each reports for fakes or hoax and comments them accordignly. The reports are
                classified by their occurred date,
                location, shape and duration. </p>

            <p> To get a taste for an UFO report, here are two typical UFO encounters: </p>

                <p class="mb-0">Triangle UFO in Orlando.
                    Saw something in the distance. Stared at it for about a minute and it began coming closer. It
                    was triangle shaped and it started to follow me and lower in closer to the direction i was
                    walking. I turned around and called someone close by to pick me up.

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Orb of light crosses the sky and turns sharply in Chicago Suburbs.
                    Leaving my office after working well into the night, an amber orb of light moved across the sky
                    above me to the south of my location and then seemed to become multiple lights (still in one unit)
                    and became more white colored. The light blinked at an interval but not like any plane I’ve seen. It
                    made no sound yet was only a couple hundred feet above ground. It then turned west and south and I
                    lost sight of it for a few seconds behind buildings as I drove. It then came flying back north right
                    over me as I drove West it. Then it got higher in the sky and trurned sharply east towards Chicago
                    and paralleled interstate 90 (which I was now on going east as well) and it traveled around 90-100
                    mph before blinking out of site ahead of me. I noticed several other small lights in the sky. I felt
                    some moved and were planes others may be stars. But this area doesn’t get much visibility to stars
                    because of light pollution. This is O'Hare airport area, but this was not typical for flight
                    patterns and it turned to fast and was too small to be a plane. My cars engine light and and lights
                    went on for the first time ever (the car is in great shape) after the incident.</p>

            <p>
                Reading the above report gives you the impression, that these might be explainable with common sense,
                like air craft or meteorite.
