            <p>The National UFO Reporting Center (<a href="http://nuforc.org">NUFORC</a>) is an organization in the
                United States that investigates and collects UFO sightings since 1974. The reports are publically
                available. We analyzed the reports in order to answer the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Are UFO sightings explainable?</li>
                <li>Is there any relation between shape and emotion?</li>

            <h3 class="title">What kind of data do we have?</h3>
            <p>The NUFORC checks each reports for fakes or hoax and comments them accordingly. The reports are
                classified by their occurred date,
                location, shape and duration. </p>

            <p> To get a taste for an UFO report, here are two typical UFO encounters: </p>

                    Leaving my office after working well into the night, an amber orb of light moved across the sky
                    above me to the south of my location and then seemed to become multiple lights (still in one unit)
                    and became more white colored. The light blinked at an interval but not like any plane I’ve seen. It
                    made no sound yet was only a couple hundred feet above ground. It then turned west and south and I
                    lost sight of it for a few seconds behind buildings as I drove. It then came flying back north right
                    over me as I drove West it. Then it got higher in the sky and trurned sharply east towards Chicago
                    and paralleled interstate 90 (which I was now on going east as well) and it traveled around 90-100
                    mph before blinking out of site ahead of me. I noticed several other small lights in the sky. I felt
                    some moved and were planes others may be stars. But this area doesn’t get much visibility to stars
                    because of light pollution. This is O'Hare airport area, but this was not typical for flight
                    patterns and it turned to fast and was too small to be a plane. My cars engine light and and lights
                    went on for the first time ever (the car is in great shape) after the incident.</p>

            <p>
                Reading the above report gives you the impression, that these might be explainable with common sense,
                like air craft or meteorite or some sort of seasonal data. Thus we are looking deeper
                into the possible explanations for reports in general.

                <div class="col">
                    <p>A reports submission splits into three parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Occurred</b>: when the UFO sighting was noticed</li>
                        <li><b>Reported</b>: when the sighting was reported to the NUFORC</li>
                        <li><b>Posted</b>: the actual report was published online</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> The report with the oldest occurrence time is from 1762 which is a report from a <a
                            href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50113.html">London newspaper</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our goal is to understand if we can explain the results through specific events, like rocket
                        launches, seasonal weather analysis, etc. Thus we show the amount of reports occuring per each
                        month
                        over our time period.

                <div class="col">
                    <p>The above plot shows the amount of reported occurances per month from 1900-2018. We can see a
                        very clear
                        trend that during the summer months when is an increase in submitted reports. This can be
                        reasoned
                        with very logicaly, because during warmer periods people tend to spend more time outside, thus
                        have
                        a higher probability of making a sighting of a UFO.
                    </p>
                    <p>But we see a clear increase in July, thus we will be investigating this month more, by plotting
                        the
                        reports from July over the time frame 1900 to 2018.

            <img src="img/july.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

            <p> Now, here things start to become very interesting. We can quite obviously see an increase for the
                4th of July, as a lot of sightings might be connected with the fireworks in the US.
            </p>

            <p> Though, another very clear increase is on the 15th of July, but after a google query, no specific
                occurance in the month of July was found. Thus, an investigation of the 15th of July over the years
                occurs. What is more interesting, is that the increase on the 15th day of the month can be seen
                across multiple months. </p>
            ## the figure of 12 plots
            </p>


            <p> We can see a very clear trend across all months, that during the 15th day of the month there is a
                sudden increase in occured reportings of UFOs. Also, in most months there is a peak on the first day
                of the month and in some on the last one. And in some months there are also other peaks, which most
                of the time can be explained due to holidays, such as the 4th of July of New Years Eve, when
                fireworks are very prevalent. </p>

            <p> To get a better understanding of the peaks that occur in the middle of the month, we will plot the
                time between the Occurrence and Reporting of the sighting over days of the month.
                ##boxplotzzz
            </p>

            <p>
                We see that we have some suspicious dates, where the mean is higher than for the other ones, these
                days fall on 'round' numbers, thus we propose that these dates are artificially inflated. In other
                words, UFO reporters which submit their reports after a longer time will have a bias towards round
                dates, which has been shown in previous research as well. {ref: Huttenlocher (1990)}
            </p>

            <p>
                To check this further we will do Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on these dates to see if their empirical
                distribution matches the distribution of the other dates. From the test we got a p-value \<\0.05,
                thus we can reject the null hypothesis, meaning, that they are not of the same distribution. This
                further means, that reporters have a certain bias towards round dates after a long time between the
                occurance of the sighting and the reporting itself.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Other spikes</h3>
                <p>The previous analysis only covers spikes, which are create themselves
                    due to the bias of reporters. Thus, it is not an explanation per say
                    of the reports, but of the reason why they aggragate at these specific dates.</p>

                <p>
                    To look more in depth in special cases/other peaks, we are plotting
                    intensity of occurrence over the period 2004-2007 for all the months.

                <p> After some manual searching for the peaks we found reasons for some
                    of them, while other were reported in the news as UFOs as well.

                    describe similar to that of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_triangle_(UFO)

                <p>By manually checking the days of the peaks we could find reasonable explanations for most of
                    them, such as rocket launches, space station fueling missions, meteorites, etc. But at the same
                    time some peaks didn't leave any seeming correlation with events that could be explainable from
                    earth/space weather or known human made flyers. </p>
